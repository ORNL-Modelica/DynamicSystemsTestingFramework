# Future Ideas

## Interactive setup wizard

- Guided terminal flow for creating or editing `testing.json`
- Prompts for: library path, simulator selection (scan for installed Dymola versions), dependencies, reference root location
- If `testing.json` already exists, offer to edit fields interactively
- Reduces onboarding friction for new libraries — no need to hand-write JSON

## Test discovery by `extends` or folder

- Find testable models by scanning for classes that extend a specific base (e.g., `extends Modelica.Icons.Example` or a custom test icon)
- Alternatively, discover all models within a specific package/folder (e.g., everything under `MyLib.Examples.*`)
- Complements UnitTests and test_spec: UnitTests requires in-model instrumentation, test_spec requires manual enumeration, extends-based discovery is automatic
- Could generate a test_spec.json from discovered models as a starting point

## Dependency-aware test ordering

- Parse model dependencies (extends, component instantiation) to build a dependency graph
- Order tests bottom-up: base models first, composed models later
- Benefits:
  - Early failure of a base model explains why complex models also fail — avoids chasing symptoms in the wrong model
  - Could skip dependent tests when a base model fails (fail-fast with clear root cause)
  - Provides natural priority when time-constrained (test fundamentals first)
- Challenges:
  - Dependency parsing requires reading Modelica model structure (extends chains, component types)
  - Cross-package dependencies add complexity
  - Some test models may not have clean dependency relationships

## Manifest compaction / ID reset

- Over time, obsolete test IDs accumulate in the manifest (marked obsolete but never reused)
- A "compact" operation would: remove all obsolete entries, renumber active tests starting from 0001, rename reference files to match, and rewrite the manifest
- Useful when a library has undergone major restructuring and the manifest has significant gaps
- Should be a deliberate, manual operation (not automatic) since it rewrites all reference files

## Configurable variable ordering in references and reports

- Allow users to define preferred variable display order via config (e.g., in `testing.json` or a separate preference)
- Pinned variables appear first in reference JSON, HTML reports, and plots; remaining variables follow in their natural order
- Default pins could include diagnostic variables (`CPUtime`, `EventCounter`) at the top
- Could be simulator-specific (Dymola diagnostics differ from OpenModelica) or user-specific
- Keeps the most important signals visible without scrolling through dozens of variables

## Filtered interactive review

- Run all tests but only prompt for specific categories: `--interactive=failed`, `--interactive=no-baseline`, `--interactive=warnings`
- Passing tests are silently accepted/skipped without user interaction
- Avoids pressing `s` dozens of times to get to the few tests that need attention
- Could combine filters: `--interactive=failed,no-baseline` to review both failures and new tests
- Default `-i` behavior stays the same (prompt for everything)
