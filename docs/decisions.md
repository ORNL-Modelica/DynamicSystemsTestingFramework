# Decisions Log

## D1: Standalone repo, not embedded in TRANSFORM-Library

- **What**: ModelicaTesting is its own repo with `src/` layout, not a subdirectory of any Modelica library.
- **Why**: The tool is library-agnostic. Embedding it in one library's repo couples release cycles and makes reuse awkward.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires a separate install step (`uv run`) and version coordination. Acceptable given early stage.

## D2: Numeric test IDs

- **What**: Reference files are named `ref_0001.json`, `ref_0002.json`, etc. Each file contains `model_id` and `test_id` as metadata. IDs are never reused — obsolete tests are marked, not deleted.
- **Why**: Modelica model paths like `TRANSFORM.Fluid.Pipes.Examples.GenericPipe_withWall_Counter_wTraceMass` exceed Windows MAX_PATH (260 chars) when used as filenames. Abbreviated names were fragile and collision-prone.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires scanning ref files at startup to build the in-memory index. Reference files are partitioned per simulator+OS.

## D3: Reference partitioning by simulator and OS

- **What**: References live at `<reference_root>/<SimulatorBackend>/<os>/ref_NNNN.json`.
- **Why**: Different solvers (Dymola vs OpenModelica) and platforms (Windows vs Linux) produce numerically different results. A single baseline can't serve all combinations.
- **Trade-offs**: More files to manage. The manifest is shared (IDs are stable across platforms), only the reference data differs.

## D4: Batch execution for Dymola

- **What**: Tests are grouped into batches. Each batch runs in one Dymola session: load libraries once, simulate N tests, exit. Per-test subdirectories prevent file conflicts.
- **Why**: Dymola startup + library loading takes 30-60s. Per-test processes made a 100-test suite take hours; batch mode cuts it to minutes.
- **Trade-offs**: A batch timeout kills all remaining tests in that batch. Dymola's working directory management requires explicit `cd()` calls in `.mos` scripts.

## D5: NRMSE as comparison metric (not AbsRelRMS)

- **What**: Pass/fail uses `NRMSE = RMSE / signal_range`. For constant signals (range ~ 0), RMSE is normalized by signal magnitude (`max(|ref|)`) instead. Falls back to raw RMSE only when magnitude is also near-zero.
- **Why**: Simpler and more interpretable than Modelica's AbsRelRMS. Range normalization makes tolerance meaningful across variables with different magnitudes. Magnitude normalization for constants avoids spurious failures from float32 quantization noise on large values (e.g., 512-unit error on a 37e9 constant is only 1.4e-8 relative).
- **Trade-offs**: Constant signals need special handling (the `is_constant` flag). A single tolerance value works across most cases.

## D6: Piecewise comparison at event boundaries

- **What**: Duplicate time values in results indicate Modelica events (discontinuities). The comparator splits trajectories at these boundaries and compares each segment independently, using pre-event values for segment ends and post-event values for segment starts.
- **Why**: `np.interp` on duplicate times returns the post-event value, which causes false errors when comparing identical signals across event boundaries. Piecewise comparison preserves discontinuities.
- **Trade-offs**: More complex interpolation logic. Interior segments need hybrid handling (pre-event dedup for bulk, post-event override at first point).

## D7: External test spec (`test_spec.json`) alongside UnitTests

- **What**: Tests can come from in-model `UnitTests` components, an external `test_spec.json`, or both (merged). The `source` field tracks provenance (`"unit_tests"`, `"spec"`, `"both"`).
- **Why**: Not all models have or should have `UnitTests` components. External specs allow testing models without modifying `.mo` files, and support glob patterns for variable selection.
- **Trade-offs**: Two sources of truth to reconcile. Merge logic uses spec values as overrides when both exist.

## D8: `testing.json` for library-specific configuration

- **What**: Each library has a `testing.json` with simulator selection, paths, dependencies, and setup commands. Config file search order: reference_root, repo_root, package_dir, cwd.
- **Why**: Different libraries need different simulators, dependencies, and settings. CLI flags override file config; file config overrides defaults.
- **Trade-offs**: Auto-creates a default `testing.json` if none found, which can surprise users.

## D9: No backward compatibility during development

- **What**: Format changes (manifest, reference JSON, CLI flags) are clean breaks with no legacy fallback code.
- **Why**: Early-stage repo with no external consumers.
- **Trade-offs**: Existing references must be regenerated. Migration utilities were provided during the transition and have since been removed.

## D10: Diagnostic variables (CPUtime, EventCounter) auto-captured

- **What**: `CPUtime` and `EventCounter` are automatically extracted from simulation results when present (requires `OutputCPUtime := true;` in Dymola). Full trajectories are stored in a `diagnostics` section of the reference JSON. Final values are added to `statistics` for simple change detection.
- **Why**: CPU time and event counts are critical for diagnosing performance regressions and model changes, but shouldn't cause pass/fail. Storing trajectories enables plotting; storing finals in statistics enables structural warnings.
- **Trade-offs**: Diagnostics are stored but never compared via NRMSE. EventCounter changes trigger a structural warning; CPUtime does not (too variable between runs).

## D11: Config-relative path resolution

- **What**: All relative paths in `testing.json` (`package_path`, `test_spec`, `dependencies`, `reference_root`) resolve relative to where `testing.json` was found, not relative to the library or cwd.
- **Why**: When references live in a separate repo, config and test specs sit together in that repo. Resolving relative to the library root would require fragile cross-repo relative paths. This also enables a single `--config` or `--reference-root` flag to drive everything.
- **Trade-offs**: None significant. CLI flags still accept absolute paths and override config file values.

## D12: `testing.json` as single entry point

- **What**: `testing.json` can contain `package_path` pointing to the library under test. With this, a single flag (`--config` or `--reference-root`) is sufficient to run — no `--package-path` needed.
- **Why**: Reduces command-line boilerplate. The config file already knows everything about the test setup; requiring the user to also specify the library path is redundant.
- **Trade-offs**: `package_path` in the config is relative, so moving the config file breaks the path. CLI `--package-path` still overrides.

## D13: In-memory index replaces persistent manifest

- **What**: `test_manifest.json` is removed. The mapping from model IDs to ref file IDs is built in memory by scanning `ref_NNNN.json` files at the start of each run. Each ref file contains `model_id`, `test_id`, `status`, `date_added`, and `last_updated` as metadata fields.
- **Why**: The manifest was a persistent index that easily got out of sync with the ref files (e.g., after manual migration of 300+ files). Since the ref files already contain all the information, the manifest was redundant. Scanning 300 small JSON files takes under a second.
- **Trade-offs**: Slight startup cost to scan files. No way to track metadata (like date_added) outside the ref files themselves — but that's actually better since the ref files are the source of truth.

## D14: ModelicaTestingLib as top-level Modelica library

- **What**: A small Modelica library (`ModelicaTestingLib/`) lives at the project root. It contains a reusable `UnitTests` component, example models (SimpleTest, EventTest, ConstantTest, NoUnitTest), and its own reference results under `Resources/ReferenceResults/`.
- **Why**: Serves dual purpose — test fixture for the pytest suite (real `.mo` files for discovery/parsing tests) and reference implementation showing how to set up `UnitTests` in a library. Top-level placement makes it easy for users to find and reuse (e.g., the `UnitTests` component).
- **Trade-offs**: Top-level directory in the repo that isn't Python code. Could confuse contributors expecting only `src/` and `tests/`. The library is tested by the framework itself (dog-fooding).

## D15: Dymola framework settings hardcoded in runner

- **What**: `OutputCPUtime := true;` and `Advanced.UI.TranslationInCommandLog := true;` are always set in the Dymola runner's `startup.mos`, not in `testing.json`'s `simulator_setup`.
- **Why**: These are framework concerns — every test run needs CPU time diagnostics and translation statistics. Making users configure them is error-prone and adds boilerplate to every `testing.json`.
- **Trade-offs**: Users can't disable them. Acceptable since they have no effect on simulation results, only on what's logged/captured.

## D16: Translation log capture via clearlog/savelog

- **What**: Each test's `.mos` script wraps `simulateModel` with `clearlog()` before and `savelog("translation_log.txt")` after. Combined with the `Advanced.UI.TranslationInCommandLog` flag, this captures translation statistics (nonlinear/linear system sizes, continuous states, state names) per test.
- **Why**: `dslog.txt` only contains simulation runtime stats (CPU time, steps, events). Structural info (system sizes, state counts) comes from the translator and was previously lost. The translation log is essential for detecting structural model changes.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds two extra lines per test `.mos` script. `clearlog()` prevents contamination between tests. The flag name (`Advanced.UI.TranslationInCommandLog`) is Dymola 2025x+; older versions may use `Advanced.TranslationInCommandLog`.

## D17: Auto-derive numberOfIntervals from simulation results

- **What**: When neither `numberOfIntervals` nor `outputInterval` (Modelica `Interval`) is set on a test model, `store_reference()` counts unique time points from the actual result and stores the derived `numberOfIntervals`. On subsequent runs, this value is passed to `simulateModel()` for consistent output grids.
- **Why**: Dymola defaults to 500 intervals when nothing is specified. Without storing this, a future run could produce a different number of output points if someone changes Dymola defaults, causing false comparison failures.
- **Trade-offs**: The derived count may differ slightly from the Dymola default due to events adding extra time points. `numberOfIntervals` takes precedence over `outputInterval` if both are somehow set.

## D18: Custom MAT4 reader replacing scipy

- **What**: `mat_reader.py` uses a custom binary parser (~100 lines) with `numpy.memmap` instead of `scipy.io.loadmat`. Reads MAT4 headers via `struct.unpack`, loads small matrices (`name`, `dataInfo`, `data_1`) eagerly, and memory-maps `data_2` for selective row access. scipy is no longer a dependency.
- **Why**: `scipy.io.loadmat` loads the entire `data_2` matrix into memory. For large models (76,992 variables, 36MB file), this took 397 seconds — making the read phase appear to hang. The custom reader extracts only the ~10 needed variable rows via memmap, reducing this to under a second. DyMat and BuildingsPy were investigated but both use the same `loadmat` call internally.
- **Trade-offs**: We own the parser instead of delegating to scipy. Acceptable because MAT4 is a simple, stable format (unchanged since the 1990s) and the parser is straightforward. Drops ~40MB of installed dependency weight.

## D19: Jinja2 templates for HTML reports

- **What**: HTML report generation was refactored from inline f-string HTML to a Jinja2 template (`reporting/templates/comparison.html`). The Python code builds a context dict and renders through Jinja2. A `comparison_data.json` sidecar is written alongside the HTML.
- **Why**: Separating data from presentation makes the template editable without touching Python logic. The JSON sidecar enables downstream tooling (dashboards, CI integrations) to consume structured data without parsing HTML. Auto-detecting statistics fields (iterating dict keys instead of hardcoding) means new Dymola version stats appear without code changes.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds `jinja2>=3.1` as a dependency. Template syntax is less familiar than Python string formatting, but the template is self-contained and easier to maintain than scattered f-strings.

## D20: Translation log parsing — initialization section and integer system sizes

- **What**: The log parser now captures the "Initialization problem" subsection separately from simulation-level stats. System size lists (`nonlinear`, `linear`, etc.) are stored as `list[int]` with computed summary fields (`_count`, `_total`, `_max`). Initialization fields use the `init_` prefix.
- **Why**: The initialization section contains distinct nonlinear/linear system sizes and Jacobian counts that were previously missed entirely. Storing sizes as integer lists (not comma-separated strings) enables aggregation and programmatic analysis. Summary fields make structural change detection and HTML display practical without parsing long lists.
- **Trade-offs**: More fields in the statistics dict. The summary fields are redundant (derivable from the lists) but worth storing for display convenience.

## D21: Structured test_spec.json with separated simulation and comparison settings

- **What**: `test_spec.json` entries now use a structured format. Simulation parameters (`stop_time`, `tolerance`, `method`, etc.) live under a `simulation` key. Comparison settings (`tolerance`, `variable_overrides`) live under a `comparison` key. Both are optional — a minimal entry needs only `model` and `variables`. The old flat format (stop_time, tolerance at top level) is replaced.
- **Why**: Simulation tolerance (solver accuracy) and comparison tolerance (NRMSE threshold) are fundamentally different concepts. Mixing them at the top level was confusing. The structured format makes intent clear and enables per-test and per-variable comparison overrides.
- **Trade-offs**: Breaking change to `test_spec.json` format. Acceptable under D9 (no backward compatibility).

## D22: Multi-level tolerance resolution

- **What**: Comparison tolerance is resolved in priority order: per-variable override (spec) > per-variable override (reference JSON) > per-test comparison tolerance > reference JSON comparison tolerance > config.tolerance > default (1e-4). Each `VariableComparison` records `tolerance_used`.
- **Why**: Some variables (e.g., temperatures near zero) need looser tolerances than the test-level default. Per-variable overrides avoid raising the tolerance for the entire test. Storing comparison settings in the reference JSON means tolerances travel with the baseline — someone cloning the repo gets the same pass/fail behavior without needing the original test_spec.json.
- **Trade-offs**: More complex resolution logic. The `tolerance_used` field in reports makes it transparent which tolerance was applied.

## D23: Tube comparison — strict envelope with three width modes

- **What**: A tube comparison mode alongside NRMSE. Configured per-variable via `variable_overrides` with `"mode": "tube"`. Three width modes via `tube_width_mode`: `"rel"` (fraction of |reference|, default in interactive UI), `"band"` (offset in signal units, legacy `"abs"`), `"absolute"` (literal y-axis bounds). Legacy format (no `tube_width_mode`): `width = max(tube_abs, tube_rel * |reference|)`. Pass/fail is strict — the actual signal must stay inside at every point. Supports constant and time-varying tubes (`tube_points` with linear or stepwise interpolation).
- **Why**: NRMSE is a single aggregate metric that can mask localized violations — a signal might have excellent NRMSE but briefly spike outside acceptable bounds. Tubes provide pointwise guarantees. Relative mode is the most intuitive default (e.g., 2% tolerance). Band mode is useful when the tolerance has a physical unit (e.g., ±500 Pa). Absolute mode is useful when bounds are known a priori (e.g., a temperature must stay between 290 and 310 K). Time-varying tubes allow tighter tolerances during steady-state and looser ones during transients.
- **Trade-offs**: Strict checking means a single point outside the tube fails the variable. This is intentional — tubes are meant for hard bounds. NRMSE is still computed alongside tube results for reference. Interactive Plotly reports allow switching modes, editing tube points, and exporting tolerance configs.

## D25: Interactive Plotly reports via CDN

- **What**: `interactive.html` is generated alongside the static `comparison.html` for each test. It uses Plotly.js loaded from CDN (`cdn.plot.ly`) for interactive charting. Per-test report links open `interactive.html` by default.
- **Why**: Static matplotlib PNGs don't support zoom, pan, or hover — critical for inspecting time series with thousands of points. Plotly.js provides these interactively in the browser without any Python server. CDN loading avoids bundling a 3MB+ JS library in the repo or generated reports.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires internet access to load Plotly.js from CDN (reports won't render charts offline). Acceptable because reports are typically viewed on developer machines with network access. A future enhancement could offer a `--bundle-plotly` flag to embed the library for offline use.

## D24: Stale artifact protection

- **What**: Test directories are cleaned (`rmtree` + recreate) before each simulation run. The translation log is also checked for "Translation aborted" as defense in depth.
- **Why**: Stale `dsres.mat` or `dslog.txt` from a previous run could be misread as current results, causing silent false passes. This is especially dangerous when a simulation fails silently (no crash, just no output) and old artifacts remain.
- **Trade-offs**: Slightly slower startup (directory recreation). Acceptable for correctness.

## D26: Tube bounds resolve-then-interpolate

- **What**: When computing tube bounds from control points with mixed width modes (e.g., point 1 is band, point 2 is relative), each control point is first resolved to its final absolute y-bound, then those resolved values are linearly interpolated across the reference time grid.
- **Why**: The alternative — interpolating raw values between control points and applying modes after — creates discontinuities at mode boundaries. For example, interpolating a band value of 0.25 toward a relative value of 1.0 produces a smooth raw curve, but applying the mode stepwise causes a jump when the mode switches from band to relative. Resolve-first ensures the tube envelope is always a smooth interpolation between the user's intended bounds.
- **Trade-offs**: The interpolated bound between two control points is a straight line in y-space, which may not match what you'd get from interpolating in width-space for a single mode. This is acceptable — mixed-mode points are inherently about defining specific bound values at specific times.

## D27: Variable naming fallback for complex expressions

- **What**: When a UnitTests component uses a complex expression like `cat(1, eta, lambda)` for its tracked variables, all variables fall back to `x[1]`...`x[n]` naming. The comparator also sanitizes names from stored reference JSON (newlines, `cat(` prefix).
- **Why**: The parser can decompose simple `x={a, b, c}` into individual names, but `cat()` requires knowing array sizes at parse time (which array has how many elements). Guessing is worse than admitting we don't know. Showing `cat(1, eta, lambda)` as the first variable's name and `x[2]`...`x[n]` for the rest is misleading — the expression describes the whole array, not one element.
- **Trade-offs**: Users lose meaningful names for `cat()` variables. The raw expression is preserved in `TestModel.x_raw` and could be surfaced as a tooltip or header in future UI improvements.

## D28: Pluggable comparison modes via strategy pattern

- **What**: Comparison logic uses a `ComparisonMode` ABC (`comparison/modes.py`) with three implementations: `NrmseMode`, `TubeMode`, `FinalOnlyMode`. Each has a typed frozen config dataclass. `resolve_mode(var_override, tolerance, default_final_only)` factory converts per-variable override dicts to mode instances.
- **Why**: Replaces if/elif dispatch in `compare_test()`. Per-variable mode selection is type-safe. Adding new comparison strategies (Frechet distance, spectral coherence, x-direction tolerance) requires only a new class — no changes to the comparator orchestration. Also fixes a bug where `config.final_only` silently overrode explicit `mode: "tube"` settings.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds indirection (dict → dataclass → mode). `TubeConfig.to_dict()` bridges back to the flat dict format for the existing `_compare_tube()` internals.

## D29: Comparator functions take scalar args, not Config

- **What**: `compare_test()` and `compare_all()` take `default_tolerance: float` and `final_only: bool` instead of `config: Config`. The `comparison/comparator.py` module no longer imports Config.
- **Why**: Only two Config fields were used. Passing the full object coupled comparison logic to the Config API, making unit tests require mock Config construction. Scalar args are simpler to test and make the dependency explicit.
- **Trade-offs**: CLI layer must extract values from Config before calling. Minimal burden.

## D30: Simulator registry with self-registration

- **What**: `simulators/__init__.py` provides a `@register(name)` decorator and `get_runner(config)` factory. `DymolaRunner` is decorated with `@register("Dymola")`. Built-in backends are lazy-imported on first use.
- **Why**: Replaces hard-coded `if backend == "Dymola"` in the CLI. Adding a new backend (e.g., OpenModelica) requires only implementing the runner class with `@register("OpenModelica")` — no changes to the CLI or factory.
- **Trade-offs**: Lazy import adds a small indirection. Built-in backend names are still listed in a hardcoded dict for the lazy import, but this is a single line per backend.

## D31: Simulator-specific config via DymolaConfig

- **What**: `DymolaConfig` frozen dataclass in `simulators/dymola/runner.py` holds `show_ide`, `simulator_setup`, `diagnostic_variables`. Constructed via `DymolaConfig.from_config(config)` at runner init.
- **Why**: These fields on Config are meaningless for non-Dymola backends. Extracting them into a typed dataclass documents what's Dymola-specific and gives the runner a clean, immutable config object. Config itself is unchanged (fields still loaded from testing.json) to avoid format disruption.
- **Trade-offs**: Slight duplication — fields exist on both Config and DymolaConfig during transition. Acceptable until a second backend motivates removing them from Config.

## D32: Report directories use ref/test IDs, not model names

- **What**: Per-test report directories are named `ref_NNNN` (when a reference exists) or `test_NNNN` (for no-baseline tests) instead of sanitized model names.
- **Why**: Long Modelica model names (e.g., `TRANSFORM.Fluid.ClosureRelations...CHFtransition_F1D`) exceeded Windows' 260-character path limit after sanitization. Ref/test IDs are short and already available. The index page provides the human-readable mapping.
- **Trade-offs**: Directory names are no longer self-describing. Acceptable because users navigate via the index page, not by browsing directories.

## D33: Per-test report dirs cleared on regeneration

- **What**: `generate_comparison_plots()` does `rmtree(plot_dir)` before recreating. Sibling test reports and the index are untouched.
- **Why**: Stale PNGs from a prior run (different variable set, different mode) would otherwise accumulate. Per-test granularity supports incremental workflows (#38) without nuking the whole report tree.
- **Trade-offs**: Hand-added files inside a test's report dir are lost on regeneration. Acceptable — that directory is generated output.

## D34: Backend-agnostic live progress dashboard

- **What**: `simulators/progress.py` provides a thread-safe `ProgressReporter` that writes `status.json` + `dashboard.html` to `work_dir` on every state change. Dashboard uses `<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2">` for auto-update — works over `file://` with no server. Each test row links to its work directory; model name links to its per-test report (`reports/{ref_NNNN|test_NNNN}/interactive.html`).
- **Why**: The previous batched parallel mode produced no output until each batch finished — runs looked frozen. JSON + meta-refresh HTML gives live visibility with zero infrastructure. Backend-agnostic means future simulators inherit the dashboard for free.
- **Trade-offs**: Within a Dymola batch, individual test transitions aren't observable — all batch members flip from `queued` → `running` together at batch start, then to their final status when the batch completes. Per-test granularity requires either log tailing or persistent workers (deferred).
- **Atomic writes**: each write uses a unique tmp filename (`status.json.{pid}.{uuid}.tmp`) and a dedicated `_write_lock` serializes the `write + replace`. Without both, concurrent threads collide on Windows where `replace` fails when another thread holds the file open.

## D36: Persistent batch manifest (accumulating test_keys)

- **What**: `batch_manifest.json` accumulates entries across runs. The new `assign_test_keys()` helper (in `simulators/base.py`) loads the existing manifest, reuses the existing `test_NNNN` for any model already known, and assigns the next sequential number for new models. Each entry tracks `last_run_at`. Per-test work directories are only `rmtree`'d for tests being run this invocation; prior dirs are left intact.
- **Why**: Enables the incremental-rerun workflow (#38). Previously a `--filter`'d rerun assigned `test_0001..test_K` to the K filtered tests, colliding with the original full run's directory layout. With persistent keys, the same model always lands in the same dir — reruns naturally overwrite their own slot, leaving the rest of the suite's results undisturbed.
- **Trade-offs**: Renamed/removed models leave orphan entries in the manifest. Acceptable; future cleanup command can prune them. The manifest grows monotonically over time. Stale results stay stale until rerun — `last_run_at` makes this visible.

## D37: --merge flag for incremental rerun + full report

- **What**: `run --merge` (typically with `--filter`) expands the read/compare/report scope to every test in the persistent batch manifest, not just the just-run subset. Tests with prior results are read from disk; the just-run tests have fresh data.
- **Why**: Without this, `run --filter X --report` produces a report covering only X — losing visibility into the other ~99% of the suite. The incremental workflow is the common case for debugging large suites: rerun a few failing tests, see their fresh status alongside the rest.
- **Trade-offs**: Stale results from prior runs are reported as if current. To make this visible, `last_run_at` is shown per test (relative time on the index, ISO timestamp on the per-test report) and rows >60s older than the newest run are greyed out with a "Stale" tooltip.

## D41: Persistent Dymola workers via Python interface

- **What**: `--persistent` on `run` swaps to `PersistentDymolaRunner` which keeps N long-lived `DymolaInterface` processes alive. Each worker loads the library once; tests are dispatched one at a time via a shared `queue.Queue`. Per-test timeouts kill the worker's Dymola via `psutil` (PID tracked via a serialized-launch snapshot diff); workers auto-restart up to 3 times. Noise from Dymola's internal urllib retries (WinError 10061/10054) is muted during kill windows via monkey-patching `DymolaLogger._PrintMessage`.
- **Why**: The batched `.mos` runner has three limitations: no per-test live progress inside a batch, poor load balancing (long tests stall workers), and batch-level crash/timeout blast radius. Persistent workers fix all three — library-load cost paid once per worker lifetime, queue gives natural work-stealing, timeouts kill just the bad test's worker while others keep running. Dymola ships the Python interface with every install (as `.whl` or `.egg`), so there's no extra install burden — the loader auto-discovers and extracts it.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires the Dymola Python interface archive (ships with Dymola; `check-dymola` diagnoses discovery). Launches are serialized by `_LAUNCH_LOCK` so we can reliably attribute new Dymola PIDs to the worker that spawned them — makes startup N × launch-time rather than parallel (~7s per launch, so 10 workers ≈ 70s of serialized launches before libs load in parallel). Batch mode remains the default until persistent mode has more field testing; both coexist.

## D40: Batch actions on the index page (client-side only)

- **What**: Index page has per-row checkboxes + an action panel for selecting tests and exporting them as a filter for the CLI: copy comma-list, download `selected.txt`, copy a ready-to-paste `run --filter ... --merge --report` command. Bulk selectors (+ Failed, + Sim Failed, + No Baseline, + With Warnings, + Stale) speed up the common cases.
- **Why**: Closes the loop on the incremental workflow (#35 + #38). Previously users had to hand-build a filter file or remember model IDs across the report and the CLI. Click-driven selection eliminates the bookkeeping. Stays purely client-side — no server, no API, works over `file://` — so it composes with the existing self-contained HTML reports.
- **Trade-offs**: No "rerun directly from the page" — that would require the optional server mode (#29). The smart command-string templating uses `modelica-testing` as the entry point assuming the project is installed; users on `uv run python -m modelica_testing` need to swap the prefix. Acceptable; the model_ids are the part you can't easily produce by hand.

## D39: Orphan cleanup is explicit, not automatic

- **What**: `run` and `compare` print a one-line notice when the batch manifest contains entries for models no longer in `discover_tests`, but never delete anything. `manifest cleanup --orphans` lists orphans + their on-disk dirs (work and report); `--apply` actually removes manifest entries + dirs.
- **Why**: Discovery is fragile in subtle ways — a transient `.mo` parse error, a missing dependency, a partial branch checkout, an upstream library not loaded — any of which temporarily shrinks the discovered set. Auto-pruning would silently delete real test data based on a transient discovery failure. Notice + explicit command gives visibility without that footgun. Matches existing safety stance for `manifest cleanup` of obsolete refs.
- **Trade-offs**: Disk bloat accumulates until the user runs the command. Acceptable; users notice via the notice and can clean when ready.

## D38: --rerun for status-driven test selection

- **What**: `run --rerun [CATEGORIES]` reads prior comparisons (no new sim yet), filters discovered tests to those matching the categories (`failed`, `no-baseline`, `warnings`, `sim-failed`, `passed`; comma-separated; default `failed`), then runs only those. Implies `--merge`.
- **Why**: The most common incremental workflow is "rerun the ones that failed last time". Building a `@failed.txt` filter file by hand is tedious; `--rerun` automates it using the same vocabulary as the interactive review filter (`-i`) for consistency.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires prior results to exist (errors out if not). Reuses `compare_all` so adds a comparison pass before the run; cheap relative to simulation.

## D35: Configurable batch size (queue-dispatched small batches)

- **What**: `Config.batch_size` (CLI: `--batch-size N`). When unset, behavior is unchanged: one big batch per worker (`ceil(total/parallel)` tests each). When set, tests are chunked into many small batches and **all** submitted to the `ThreadPoolExecutor`; workers pull the next batch as they free up.
- **Why**: Current static partitioning has two pain points: poor load balancing (long tests stall a worker while others idle) and large blast radius on failure (one hung test takes down its entire batch via the summed-timeout). Smaller batches fix both. `worker_id` in the dashboard is now derived from the actual thread slot (via `threading.current_thread().name`) rather than batch index, so attribution stays stable across many batches.
- **Trade-offs**: More library reloads (Dymola's 30-60s startup pays per batch). Sweet spot is ~3-10 depending on per-test runtime. `batch_size=1` defeats the purpose — same as one-test-per-process.
