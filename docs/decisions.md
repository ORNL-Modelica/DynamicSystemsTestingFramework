# Decisions Log

## D1: Standalone repo, not embedded in TRANSFORM-Library

- **What**: ModelicaTesting is its own repo with `src/` layout, not a subdirectory of any Modelica library.
- **Why**: The tool is library-agnostic. Embedding it in one library's repo couples release cycles and makes reuse awkward.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires a separate install step (`uv run`) and version coordination. Acceptable given early stage.

## D2: Numeric test IDs

- **What**: Reference files are named `ref_0001.json`, `ref_0002.json`, etc. Each file contains `model_id` and `test_id` as metadata. IDs are never reused — obsolete tests are marked, not deleted.
- **Why**: Modelica model paths like `TRANSFORM.Fluid.Pipes.Examples.GenericPipe_withWall_Counter_wTraceMass` exceed Windows MAX_PATH (260 chars) when used as filenames. Abbreviated names were fragile and collision-prone.
- **Trade-offs**: Requires scanning ref files at startup to build the in-memory index. Reference files are partitioned per simulator+OS.

## D3: Reference partitioning by simulator and OS

- **What**: References live at `<reference_root>/<SimulatorBackend>/<os>/ref_NNNN.json`.
- **Why**: Different solvers (Dymola vs OpenModelica) and platforms (Windows vs Linux) produce numerically different results. A single baseline can't serve all combinations.
- **Trade-offs**: More files to manage. The manifest is shared (IDs are stable across platforms), only the reference data differs.

## D4: Batch execution for Dymola

- **What**: Tests are grouped into batches. Each batch runs in one Dymola session: load libraries once, simulate N tests, exit. Per-test subdirectories prevent file conflicts.
- **Why**: Dymola startup + library loading takes 30-60s. Per-test processes made a 100-test suite take hours; batch mode cuts it to minutes.
- **Trade-offs**: A batch timeout kills all remaining tests in that batch. Dymola's working directory management requires explicit `cd()` calls in `.mos` scripts.

## D5: NRMSE as comparison metric (not AbsRelRMS)

- **What**: Pass/fail uses `NRMSE = RMSE / signal_range`. For constant signals (range ~ 0), raw RMSE is used directly.
- **Why**: Simpler and more interpretable than Modelica's AbsRelRMS. Signal range normalization makes the tolerance meaningful across variables with different magnitudes.
- **Trade-offs**: Constant signals need special handling (the `is_constant` flag). A single tolerance value works across most cases.

## D6: Piecewise comparison at event boundaries

- **What**: Duplicate time values in results indicate Modelica events (discontinuities). The comparator splits trajectories at these boundaries and compares each segment independently, using pre-event values for segment ends and post-event values for segment starts.
- **Why**: `np.interp` on duplicate times returns the post-event value, which causes false errors when comparing identical signals across event boundaries. Piecewise comparison preserves discontinuities.
- **Trade-offs**: More complex interpolation logic. Interior segments need hybrid handling (pre-event dedup for bulk, post-event override at first point).

## D7: External test spec (`test_spec.json`) alongside UnitTests

- **What**: Tests can come from in-model `UnitTests` components, an external `test_spec.json`, or both (merged). The `source` field tracks provenance (`"unit_tests"`, `"spec"`, `"both"`).
- **Why**: Not all models have or should have `UnitTests` components. External specs allow testing models without modifying `.mo` files, and support glob patterns for variable selection.
- **Trade-offs**: Two sources of truth to reconcile. Merge logic uses spec values as overrides when both exist.

## D8: `testing.json` for library-specific configuration

- **What**: Each library has a `testing.json` with simulator selection, paths, dependencies, and setup commands. Config file search order: reference_root, repo_root, package_dir, cwd.
- **Why**: Different libraries need different simulators, dependencies, and settings. CLI flags override file config; file config overrides defaults.
- **Trade-offs**: Auto-creates a default `testing.json` if none found, which can surprise users.

## D9: No backward compatibility during development

- **What**: Format changes (manifest, reference JSON, CLI flags) are clean breaks with no legacy fallback code.
- **Why**: Early-stage repo with no external consumers.
- **Trade-offs**: Existing references must be regenerated. Migration utilities were provided during the transition and have since been removed.

## D10: Diagnostic variables (CPUtime, EventCounter) auto-captured

- **What**: `CPUtime` and `EventCounter` are automatically extracted from simulation results when present (requires `OutputCPUtime := true;` in Dymola). Full trajectories are stored in a `diagnostics` section of the reference JSON. Final values are added to `statistics` for simple change detection.
- **Why**: CPU time and event counts are critical for diagnosing performance regressions and model changes, but shouldn't cause pass/fail. Storing trajectories enables plotting; storing finals in statistics enables structural warnings.
- **Trade-offs**: Diagnostics are stored but never compared via NRMSE. EventCounter changes trigger a structural warning; CPUtime does not (too variable between runs).

## D11: Config-relative path resolution

- **What**: All relative paths in `testing.json` (`package_path`, `test_spec`, `dependencies`, `reference_root`) resolve relative to where `testing.json` was found, not relative to the library or cwd.
- **Why**: When references live in a separate repo, config and test specs sit together in that repo. Resolving relative to the library root would require fragile cross-repo relative paths. This also enables a single `--config` or `--reference-root` flag to drive everything.
- **Trade-offs**: None significant. CLI flags still accept absolute paths and override config file values.

## D12: `testing.json` as single entry point

- **What**: `testing.json` can contain `package_path` pointing to the library under test. With this, a single flag (`--config` or `--reference-root`) is sufficient to run — no `--package-path` needed.
- **Why**: Reduces command-line boilerplate. The config file already knows everything about the test setup; requiring the user to also specify the library path is redundant.
- **Trade-offs**: `package_path` in the config is relative, so moving the config file breaks the path. CLI `--package-path` still overrides.

## D13: In-memory index replaces persistent manifest

- **What**: `test_manifest.json` is removed. The mapping from model IDs to ref file IDs is built in memory by scanning `ref_NNNN.json` files at the start of each run. Each ref file contains `model_id`, `test_id`, `status`, `date_added`, and `last_updated` as metadata fields.
- **Why**: The manifest was a persistent index that easily got out of sync with the ref files (e.g., after manual migration of 300+ files). Since the ref files already contain all the information, the manifest was redundant. Scanning 300 small JSON files takes under a second.
- **Trade-offs**: Slight startup cost to scan files. No way to track metadata (like date_added) outside the ref files themselves — but that's actually better since the ref files are the source of truth.

## D14: ModelicaTestingLib as top-level Modelica library

- **What**: A small Modelica library (`ModelicaTestingLib/`) lives at the project root. It contains a reusable `UnitTests` component, example models (SimpleTest, EventTest, ConstantTest, NoUnitTest), and its own reference results under `Resources/ReferenceResults/`.
- **Why**: Serves dual purpose — test fixture for the pytest suite (real `.mo` files for discovery/parsing tests) and reference implementation showing how to set up `UnitTests` in a library. Top-level placement makes it easy for users to find and reuse (e.g., the `UnitTests` component).
- **Trade-offs**: Top-level directory in the repo that isn't Python code. Could confuse contributors expecting only `src/` and `tests/`. The library is tested by the framework itself (dog-fooding).

## D15: Dymola framework settings hardcoded in runner

- **What**: `OutputCPUtime := true;` and `Advanced.UI.TranslationInCommandLog := true;` are always set in the Dymola runner's `startup.mos`, not in `testing.json`'s `simulator_setup`.
- **Why**: These are framework concerns — every test run needs CPU time diagnostics and translation statistics. Making users configure them is error-prone and adds boilerplate to every `testing.json`.
- **Trade-offs**: Users can't disable them. Acceptable since they have no effect on simulation results, only on what's logged/captured.

## D16: Translation log capture via clearlog/savelog

- **What**: Each test's `.mos` script wraps `simulateModel` with `clearlog()` before and `savelog("translation_log.txt")` after. Combined with the `Advanced.UI.TranslationInCommandLog` flag, this captures translation statistics (nonlinear/linear system sizes, continuous states, state names) per test.
- **Why**: `dslog.txt` only contains simulation runtime stats (CPU time, steps, events). Structural info (system sizes, state counts) comes from the translator and was previously lost. The translation log is essential for detecting structural model changes.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds two extra lines per test `.mos` script. `clearlog()` prevents contamination between tests. The flag name (`Advanced.UI.TranslationInCommandLog`) is Dymola 2025x+; older versions may use `Advanced.TranslationInCommandLog`.

## D17: Auto-derive numberOfIntervals from simulation results

- **What**: When neither `numberOfIntervals` nor `outputInterval` (Modelica `Interval`) is set on a test model, `store_reference()` counts unique time points from the actual result and stores the derived `numberOfIntervals`. On subsequent runs, this value is passed to `simulateModel()` for consistent output grids.
- **Why**: Dymola defaults to 500 intervals when nothing is specified. Without storing this, a future run could produce a different number of output points if someone changes Dymola defaults, causing false comparison failures.
- **Trade-offs**: The derived count may differ slightly from the Dymola default due to events adding extra time points. `numberOfIntervals` takes precedence over `outputInterval` if both are somehow set.

## D18: Custom MAT4 reader replacing scipy

- **What**: `mat_reader.py` uses a custom binary parser (~100 lines) with `numpy.memmap` instead of `scipy.io.loadmat`. Reads MAT4 headers via `struct.unpack`, loads small matrices (`name`, `dataInfo`, `data_1`) eagerly, and memory-maps `data_2` for selective row access. scipy is no longer a dependency.
- **Why**: `scipy.io.loadmat` loads the entire `data_2` matrix into memory. For large models (76,992 variables, 36MB file), this took 397 seconds — making the read phase appear to hang. The custom reader extracts only the ~10 needed variable rows via memmap, reducing this to under a second. DyMat and BuildingsPy were investigated but both use the same `loadmat` call internally.
- **Trade-offs**: We own the parser instead of delegating to scipy. Acceptable because MAT4 is a simple, stable format (unchanged since the 1990s) and the parser is straightforward. Drops ~40MB of installed dependency weight.

## D19: Jinja2 templates for HTML reports

- **What**: HTML report generation was refactored from inline f-string HTML to a Jinja2 template (`reporting/templates/comparison.html`). The Python code builds a context dict and renders through Jinja2. A `comparison_data.json` sidecar is written alongside the HTML.
- **Why**: Separating data from presentation makes the template editable without touching Python logic. The JSON sidecar enables downstream tooling (dashboards, CI integrations) to consume structured data without parsing HTML. Auto-detecting statistics fields (iterating dict keys instead of hardcoding) means new Dymola version stats appear without code changes.
- **Trade-offs**: Adds `jinja2>=3.1` as a dependency. Template syntax is less familiar than Python string formatting, but the template is self-contained and easier to maintain than scattered f-strings.

## D20: Translation log parsing — initialization section and integer system sizes

- **What**: The log parser now captures the "Initialization problem" subsection separately from simulation-level stats. System size lists (`nonlinear`, `linear`, etc.) are stored as `list[int]` with computed summary fields (`_count`, `_total`, `_max`). Initialization fields use the `init_` prefix.
- **Why**: The initialization section contains distinct nonlinear/linear system sizes and Jacobian counts that were previously missed entirely. Storing sizes as integer lists (not comma-separated strings) enables aggregation and programmatic analysis. Summary fields make structural change detection and HTML display practical without parsing long lists.
- **Trade-offs**: More fields in the statistics dict. The summary fields are redundant (derivable from the lists) but worth storing for display convenience.
